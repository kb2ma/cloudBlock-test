Example use of the cloud block with the [balenablocks/sensor](https://github.com/balenablocks/sensor) block as input, including a `docker-compose.yml` file for configuration. See the sensor block documentation for supported sensors. We have used a BME280 temp/humidity/pressure sensor with it. You should not need custom code to use the sensor block.

Uses kb2ma/cloud:fincm3 image for cloudBlock. `pubsub.yaml` file elided because it contains secrets. See [dapr example](https://docs.dapr.io/reference/components-reference/supported-bindings/gcppubsub/) for contents, which also correspond to cloudBlock [documentation](https://github.com/balena-io-playground/cloudBlock/blob/main/doc/GcpPubsubOutputVars.md).
